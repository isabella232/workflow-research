# Overview
A toolkit about workflow research? You probably have questions. Hopefully we have some helpful answers.

## What is workflow research?
Workflow research is defined here as any activity that helps you to think critically about your work.
[ working with member station statement here ]

Workflow research will help you to:
	1. reflect on your current work processes, 
	2. identify specific points of friction in your work process, and 
	3. build an informed understanding of what kinds of things would help to address those points. 

****** QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS: ******
-- Do people already know what's wrong (should this guide really help with identifying a "point of friction"), but they aren't sure how to / don't have the power to chage it ? --
-- HOW TO ADDRESS ETHICAL AND POLICICAL DYNAMICS OF ADVOCATING FOR CHANGE FROM WITHIN YOUR OWN ORG ? --
	--> From storytelling discussion at group meeting on Weds, part of this toolkit should be about how to advocate for doing this activity, how to present findings to different audiences, and how to "measure" "success"
-- WHO HAS TIME TO DO THIS / HOW DO WE HELP PEOPLE MAKE TIME TO DO THIS ? --
	--> activities broken up by time / materials / people needed ? (like a recipe, these things are listed at the top of the page)
	--> have a draft, show to folks, get their feedback

## What will this toolkit help me do?
This toolkit is meant to be a guide, because you know your work and your organization best. Some of the things that this toolkit will help you do are:
	1. create and execute a workflow research plan,
	2. collect and synthesize your findings into actionable results,
	3. explain your findings to a variety of audiences (e.g. peers, managers, customers/users, investors), and 
	4. advocate for change in your organization. ( ??? )
