# Object-relational mapping
This method of describing a workflow is based on the belief that in order to uncover points of friction work should be visible. Every part of a work process - even the most mundane, internalized, or frequent action - can provide insight into how and where process improvements can be made.

Critically thinking about your workflow is a process of unlearning; you should start thinking about your work as if you were someone who doesn't do what you do everyday.

## How granular should I go?
Although specificity is important, it is also important to not get too lost in the weeds. Document everything necessary to understanding your process, but don't get bogged down in the details. 

It can be difficult to understand exactly where this line lies, but a good benchmark is that you should be able to complete an object-relational map following this process in 30 to 60 minutes.
